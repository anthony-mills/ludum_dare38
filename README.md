# Ludum Dare 38 Entry

HTML / JS based browser game created for the 48 hour game jam [Ludum Dare #38](https://ldjam.com/). The competition theme selected was "A Small World" so Kenny Cockroach was born from this. 

The game was [Anthony Mills](https://www.anthony-mills.com) under the [Big Southerly Games](https://www.bigsoutherly.com) label on the 22nd & 23rd April 2017.

# Code Use

The game itself is built with the [Phaser framework](http://phaser.io/). The game is being released as open source, feel free to take any code from it you think can help you.
